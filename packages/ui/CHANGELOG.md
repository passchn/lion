- 84173cdb: lion-select-rich: when the overlay is shown, the "autofocus" attribute is added to \_listboxNode (\_inputNode) to make sure that keyboard navigation continues to work when the element is inside a an element with `trapsKeyboardFocus:true`, like the bottomsheet created via `withBottomSheetConfig()`. When the overlay is closed the attribute is removed.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- cee40e55: Side-effect-free alternative for `localize` (the globally shared instance of LocalizeManager).
  When this function is imported, no side-effect happened yet, i.e. no global instance was registered yet.
  The side effect-free approach generates:

  - smaller, optimized bundles
  - a predictable loading order, that allows for:
    - deduping strategies when multiple instances of the localizeManager are on a page
    - providing a customized extension of LocalizeManager

  Also see: https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/discussions/1861

  Use it like this:

  ```js
  function myFunction() {
    // note that 'localizeManager' is the same as former 'localize'
    const localizeManager = getLocalizeManger();
    // ...
  }
  ```

  In a class, we advise a shared instance:

  ```js
  class MyClass {
    constructor() {
      this._localizeManager = getLocalizeManger();
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Make sure to always call this method inside a function or class (otherwise side effects are created)

  Do you want to register your own LocalizeManager?
  Make sure it's registered before anyone called `getLocalizeManager()`

  ```js
  import { singletonManager } from 'singleton-manager';
  import { getLocalizeManger } from '@lion/ui/localize-no-side-effects.js';

  // First register your own LocalizeManager (for deduping or other reasons)
  singletonManager.set('lion/ui::localize::0.x', class MyLocalizeManager extends LocalizeManager {});

  // Now, all your code gets the right instance
  export function myFn() {
    const localizeManager = getLocalizeManager();
    // ...
  }

  export class myClass() {
    constructor() {
      this._localizeManager = getLocalizeManager();
      // ...
    }
  }
  ```

## 0.0.12

### Patch Changes

- 7ac0a422: [overlays] fixes (responsive backdrop/select-rich/tooltip)

## 0.0.11

### Patch Changes

- 5e707168: [tooltip] prevent infinite loops
- 49092c97: `accordion`: narrowed the scope of the selectors that query [slot=invoker] and [slot=content] to prevent that any nested elements with [slot=invoker] and [slot=content] are moved to slot=\_accordion as well
- fafd9222: overlays: add adopted stylesheets once; attach correctly to body

## 0.0.10

### Patch Changes

- 36910e5d: datepicker uses no calender-overlay-frame element anymore
- 64c0e26c: Overlay System uses `<dialog>` for top layer functionality of all overlays.
  This means overlays positioned relative to viewport won't be moved to the body.

  This has many benefits for the App Developer:

  - "context" will be kept:
    - css variables and parts/theme will work
    - events work without the need for "repropagation" (from body to original context)
    - accessibility relations between overlay content and its context do not get lost
  - initial renderings become more predictable (since we don't need multiple initializations on multiple connectedCallbacks)
  - performance: less initialization, thus better performance
  - maintainability: handling all edge cases involved in moving an overlay to the body grew out of hand
  - developer experience:
    - no extra container components like overlay-frame/calendar-frame needed that maintain styles
    - adding a contentWrapperNode is not needed anymore

  There could be small differences in timings though (usually we're done rendering quicker now).
  Code that relies on side effects could be affected. Like:

  - the existence of a global Root node)
  - the fact that global styles would reach a dialog placed in the body

  For most users using either OverlayController, OverlayMixin or an element that uses OverlayMixin (like LionInputDatepicker, LionRichSelect etc. etc.)
  nothing will change in the public api.

### Patch Changes

  Recommended approach is to do below at the top of your app (before lion code runs):

  ```js
  import { singletonManager } from 'singleton-manager';
  import { LocalizeManager } from '@lion/ui/localize-no-side-effects.js';

  class MyLocalizeManager extends LocalizeManager {}

  singletonManager.set('@lion/ui::localize::0.x', new MyLocalizeManager());
  ```

## 0.0.1

### Patch Changes

- e08b6bec: This introduces a new package `@lion/ui` which is a collection of UI components that can be used in your application. It contains all the components/systems that used to be distributed via separate `@lion/*` packages.

  This is a breaking as you will need to import all components from `@lion/ui` instead of `@lion/*` packages now.

  ```diff
  - import { LionAccordion } from '@lion/accordion';
  + import { LionAccordion } from '@lion/ui/accordion.js';
  ```

  This is also true for element registrations

  ```diff
  - import '@lion/accordion/define';
  + import '@lion/ui/define/lion-accordion.js';
  ```

  Essentially the whole public API e.g. all the available exports can be found in the [exports](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/tree/master/packages/ui/exports) folder.

  The package only supports TS 4.7+ using `"moduleResolution": "Node16"` or `"moduleResolution": "NodeNext"` as described in the [TS 4.7 Announcement](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#package-json-exports-imports-and-self-referencing).

  This package will have a new single CHANGELOG.md for the whole package. If you are interested the older individual changelogs then you can find them in the [\_legacy-changelogs folder](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/tree/master/packages/ui/_legacy-changelogs).

  This new version also includes the following changes for it's containing components:

  - fix(switch): SwitchButton do not dispatch checked-change event when is disabled
  - fix(calendar): calendar translation de.js strings corrected

  Note: This package is considered alpha until extending docs and type exports are verified.

- Updated dependencies [e08b6bec]
  - singleton-manager@1.6.0
